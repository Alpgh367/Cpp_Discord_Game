# Cpp_Discord_Game
A game made by C++ Discord.   

# Context
Hi children, in our current geopolitical context of multi-polarization of powers, everybody knows that a military conflict can break out at any moment, which is why it was decided to set up a data survival policy to be prepared to face an international nuclear conflict.

Our glorious council has arranged with many of the world's best scientific institutions and have decided that the best way for our game to survive an extinction level event is to fragment it in the smallest packets of data possible while still being meaningful.

We developped a top-secret, state-of-the-art compression technology to help us in our endeavor. One single problem, it can't compress line breaks. Which is why we imposed a hard limit on how you can contribute.

# Rules
* Each commit must have between 1 and 5 add lines.
* Each commit may have no more than 2 remove lines.
* Altering an existing line counts as both removing and adding a line.
* Each change must compile, and may not crash the game.
* You may make a commit once per day, or if your last commit is two commits old.
